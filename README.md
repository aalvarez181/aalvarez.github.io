# The data in this project is organized into several entities, These entities include resistors,capacitors,potentiometers,integrated circuits,transistors, and diodes. Each entitiy is stored as its own list within the electronics.json file allows the app to look up componenets based on the category the user selects.
# Every component record includes a drawer attribute which indicates the location of that item. Components then include either a value attribute or serial attribute depending on the type selected. There are passive components such as resistors, capacitors and potentiometers that use values like "10k" or "1.0u" while active compenents such as IC's,transistors, and diodes use serial numbers like "1N4148" or "2N3904".
# Each Component belongs to exactly one entity, and components may share the same drawer number but each entry describes a unique stored item. When a user searches the selected component type determines which entity the application looks at, and the entered value or serial number filters the componenets within that entity. That search process therefore creates a temporary relationship by matching user input to the appropiate attriubutes allowing the interface to return the correct drawer location.
